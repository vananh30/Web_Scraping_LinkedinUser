When projects required the CMS solution I use WordPress.To speed up the development of JavaScript projects I am using Vue.js as a framework and the Quasar library to build a UI, based on these technologies I can develop hybrid mobile applications.I also can develop Native Android applications using the Java language. For monitoring changes in computer files, I use Git and for issue tracking  Jira or Trello. I am writing a blog in Serbian about programming  (http://www.webprogramiranje.org ) to help grow the programming community in Serbia.","{""0"": {""School"": ""Faculty of Civil Engineering in Belgrade "", ""Major"": ""M.Sc. in Civil Engineering , Structural Engineering"", ""Duration"": ""Null""}}","{""0"": {""Job Title"": [""Android Developer""], ""Company"": [""AMD""], ""Duration"": ""Aug 2018 - Present  4 yrs"", ""Location"": ""Serbia""}, ""1"": {""Job Title"": [""Web and Mobile app developer""], ""Company"": [""ProSystem Studio  Full-time""], ""Duration"": ""Jan 2015 - Jul 2018  3 yrs 7 mos"", ""Location"": ""Serbia""}, ""2"": {""Job Title"": [""General Manager""], ""Company"": [""Prosistem Gradnja d.o.o.""], ""Duration"": ""Jan 2009 - Dec 2014  6 yrs"", ""Location"": ""Panu010devo, Serbia""}, ""3"": {""Job Title"": [""Head of technical department""], ""Company"": [""Prokal d.o.o.""], ""Duration"": ""Oct 2007 - Jan 2009  1 yr 4 mos"", ""Location"": ""Panu010devo, Serbia""}, ""4"": {""Job Title"": [""Construction Site Manager""], ""Company"": [""Grad d.o.o""], ""Duration"": ""Sep 2004 - May 2007  2 yrs 9 mos"", ""Location"": ""Panu010devo""}}","{""0"": ""JavaScript"", ""1"": ""Mobile Application Development"", ""2"": ""Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)"", ""3"": ""Web Development"", ""4"": ""Android Development"", ""5"": ""HTML5"", ""6"": ""WordPress"", ""7"": ""Java"", ""8"": ""PHP"", ""9"": ""Vue.js"", ""10"": ""Git"", ""11"": ""Android"", ""12"": ""Mobile Application Development"", ""13"": ""Web Development"", ""14"": ""Android Development"", ""15"": ""JavaScript"", ""16"": ""Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)"", ""17"": ""HTML5"", ""18"": ""WordPress"", ""19"": ""Java"", ""20"": ""PHP"", ""21"": ""Vue.js"", ""22"": ""Git"", ""23"": ""Android""}",[],[],"[""Czech"", ""English"", ""Serbian""]"

Over the last three decades since joining IBM as a Memory Component Engineer while still studying, I have worked across the depth and breadth of the IBM business globally. I have leadership experience in bridging technical, enterprise applications, services delivery, business process transformation and consulting, organizational leadership, and strategic operations and governance. Memberships in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Girls Who Code, Eta Kappa Nu, IEEE Engineering Society, and the IBM Executive Women Leadership Council  and twice by Fortune magazine: ‘Next Gen Most Powerful Women’ and ‘Most Powerful International Women’ give me opportunities to learn and collaborate to be a better leader.I am responsible for financial business results and our clients’ success in the highly dynamic Banking and Financial Services business, having returned to New York City from Singapore , where I led IBM Asia Pacific since 2020.  My focus is on ensuring clients are able to benefit from IBM solutions, services and talent to accelerate their digital transformation journeys and solve the world’s biggest challenges. My passions are working with enterprise  clients, partners and IBMers to drive business outcomes and competitive advantage from innovative technologies including Cloud, Cognitive, Data, Blockchain, Quantum, Mobility and Security. By helping teams apply design thinking approaches to business and technology transformations, we  help ensure that they have the skills required for future success. As a life-long advocate of continual learning, I am also committed to building inclusive and diverse teams, including supporting women looking to pursue a career in STEM and future leadership roles.
